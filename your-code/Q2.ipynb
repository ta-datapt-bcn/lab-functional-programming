    "Now we want to enhance the `get_bow_from_docs` function so that it will work with HTML webpages. In HTML, there are a lot of messy codes such as HTML tags, Javascripts, [unicodes](https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_misc_symbols.asp) that will mess up your bag of words. We need to clean up those junk before generating BoW.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, what you will do is to define several new functions each of which is specialized to clean up the HTML codes in one aspect. For instance, you can have a `strip_html_tags` function to remove all HTML tags, a `remove_punctuation` function to remove all punctuation, a `to_lower_case` function to convert string to lowercase, and a `remove_unicode` function to remove all unicodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then in your `get_bow_from_doc` function, you will call each of those functions you created to clean up the HTML before you generate the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Please use Python string operations and regular expression only in this lab. Do not use extra libraries such as `beautifulsoup` because otherwise you loose the purpose of practicing."

employees and clients is run   don t just ask the student how much they like attending ironhack   ask the employees how much they like working here   you can tell that everyone is happy and included   that is only possible if the culture is well established from top to bottom   they have weekly surveys which aim at gathering feedback regularly   that shows they care about being the highly regarded bootcamp that they are     the start  alex is very personalble and helpful   guiding the process from application to financial aid processing   jessica is also instrumental in guiding the newly registered so that they start off the course on the right foot   they make t a s available so that you have any questions answered before the course begins   the prework can be a free standing course   david fast and karen lum are very strong instructors that really care about your progress as a ux ui designer   then  when it s all done  you know that you are part of a new community so continuing your learning journey is almost unavoidable      topping it off is daniel brito who is maniacal in his drive to help grads find the necessary employment resources   no one who is serious should expect anyone to  find you a job   but really  you have to go out of your way in order to fail     this review is helpful 1     flag as inappropriate           ironhack      a unique oportunity

and did some coding  but nothing past basic javascript  it peaked my interest  so i began learning on my own by taking courses online  i realized i needed to go about learning in a different way  i researched courses boot camps and ran into ironhack and decided to dive in and take it s full time web dev course after coming across great reviews ratings      expectations and course run down     be ready to learn  because you re going to learn a lot  it s a full time 9  m every day for 9 weeks  not including the after hours you want to put in as well  it s no joke so just prepare to fully invest the next 9 weeks into ironhack  you learn for 2 weeks and then immediately are sent off to create a project within a week   repeat again 2 more times after that  come in prepared to learn  take in all the material  and be willing to put in the work       help during course work   curriculum  ta s and teacher       the instructor for our cohort  nick  was very knowledgeable  the only downside was that it was his first time teaching the course  so it felt like he was also learning as we were all trying to learn something too  besides that  he was most definitely a great instructor and without his proficiency on the subject  i would not have learned as much as i did  as for the teaching assistants  all three of them were amazing  sandra  marcos  ian   they were all very familiar with the coursework since they were all ironhack graduates as well  it was extremely helpful having dedicated ta s who were former students helping us because they know the struggle so they  want  to help  there s more than enough help to go around  just make sure to  ask  for it when you need it and you won t fall behind     the coursework definitely needed some tweaking on some days  our instructor nick pushed aside what he felt was wrong and obsolete and taught it the best way he could and it definitely worked out  during the course this was one of my top issues  the curriculum for sure needed an update  but from what i have seen after my time there they are  or already have  taken the steps necessary to do so  which means they take your feedback seriously and won t brush your input aside      rest of ironhack staff     since the first day i applied and even now the staff at ironhack hasn t missed a beat  they have been helpful and there for me with any questions i had  they have an idea as to what they want to do with the course  and they definitely make sure that you receive the best experience possible  it doesn t matter who you try to contact  the owner  down to the ta s  they all respond happily and make you feel like one of them      hiring fair prep     from the first week at ironhack  you become well acquainted with a man named brito  take his advice seriously if your goal is getting a job  he walks you through all the necessary steps to prepare you  such as building your resume  creating your linkedin  and lets you know about networking events to attend  he constantly brings in people to give speeches to you weekly  brito is a great source for help and information so make sure you are constantly checking in with him  along with all this prep work  you are also creating your portfolio during the course  you create 3 projects  on your own or in a small group  which showcase everything you ve learned in the course from beginning to end and is the first step to the building of your portfolio      hiring fair event     at the end of the course  brito arranges companies to come to ironhack and sit down with you for interviews  this is a valuable introduction for your first interviews  eventually  you will be off doing interviews on your own and this hiring fair is a great way to evaluate what you did and didn t do so that ultimately you become more and more comfortable during them  still  that doesn t mean you shouldn t take these interviews at the hiring fair seriously  definitely come prepared to nail them during the event   people  do  get hired out of these  this is what you prepare for  and it helps to prepare for future interviews      post ironhack experience     after ironhack  finding a job  if that is what you are there for  is the next battle  brito is there with you every step of the way  he holds placements help meetings at ironhack every other week and is always available for any questions you have  he guides you and reminds you that you must  keep coding  and  keep applying   if you slack off on those two steps  the job hunt instantly becomes much harder   take your linkedin  networking  and resume seriously  do little projects on your own after the cohort  and make sure your javascript knowledge is fresh by doing coding challenges on hackerrank codewars because they will help with the technical interviews     i did not get hired immediately after ironhack  i applied to around    jobs and only got about two handfuls of phone interviews and in person interviews  i got hired 3 and a half months after  i never stopped coding  i never stopped applying and i always kept in touch with brito  this process in itself could feel more stressful than the boot camp  but do not quit      conclusion     yes   you learn a lot at ironhack and are given great guidance  but no they will not hand you a job  you get everything you need from them and now it s up to you to put in the work and land it  they are there with you every step of the way  i would    do it again  i put my life on hold  invested in myself  pushed through and changed my career into something i felt would be more fulfilling  so far it hasn t disappointed one bit  not only do you learn a lot at ironhack  but you make tons of friends and become part of their great community        if you have any questions feel free to message me on linkedin and i will gladly answer them for you                          this review is helpful 4     flag as inappropriate           ironhack      awesome learning experience    9           alexander teodor mazilu             campus  miami    verified via linkedin     awesome learning experience    overall experience          curriculum            instructors          job assistance              i recently completed the part time web development course  and i highly recommend it to anyone looking to expand their skills or technological knowledge base  i had an all around wonderful learning experience  you don t need to have much computer knowledge going into it  because each class has multiple teaching assistants who will be there to help if you fall behind or are struggling to keep up  my class had 3 exceptional ta s  manuel  colby  and adrian  who constantly were able to provide assistance when i ran into trouble  had bugs  or just got lost  they were always nice  patient  and willing to go the extra mile just to make sure i really understood deeply what we were learning  including coming in extra early on the weekends and spending one on one time with me in front of the whiteboard to go over each aspect of what we were learning in detail  i was really impressed with  and grateful for  each of them      i was also very impressed with the professor  alan  he is an extremely knowledgeable person with a natural aptitude for teaching  always patient  courteous  and welcoming of questions  feedback and taking time to ask us if we all understood or were running into any problems  what really impressed me most about alan  is how he would take a little bit of time at the start of each class to go beyond the curriculum and to challenge us with computer science coding challenges  to prepare us to think like computer scientists  and get us ready for the types of questions we would likely see in a coding interview  and explain the different ways to approach the problems  and how to think about them in terms of time complexity or memory management  it was well beyond what i expected from a web development course  and i found these lessons particularly rewarding  alan has a knack for breaking down complex and abstract concepts into digestible bits and getting the class comfortable enough to try and collectively attempt a solution   protip  always volunteer to try and solve the problems he presents  i noticed the students brave enough to attempt these problems retained information better and walked away with a more solid understanding  if he gives you the marker  get up there and give it your best effort  go home and research the concepts further  just do it   get a whiteboard  for your house  and write important concepts  objectives  goals  and problem examples from class  this will force your brain to reconcile this new information on a daily basis  you will almost certainly see these types of coding challenges in job interviews  and they re abstract  and frustrating if you are not prepared     after graduation  you ll be counseled by brito  your career counselor  who is also a very cool  down to earth and knowledgeable person  he has some real wisdom to share about the interviewing process  how to construct your resume  and specifically tells you to reach out to him before accepting any job offers  i am really impressed with his insight and willingness to be supportive  helpful  and make sure you land a good starting job  well after graduation      looking back i am extremely thankful to ironhack and humbled to have had the opportunity to study with such an awesome class  everyone from my classmates to the teachers  to the teacher s assistants  to the career counselor have all been an absolute pleasure to deal with      also  i was blown away by the ux ui students  we  the web dev class  got a chance to work with them in the hackathon  which was a totally awesome experience  and they were very impressive  i legitimately wish i could go take their class as well because they absolutely blew my mind with their systematic methodology  creativity  and organized thought processes  they were amazing  i loved working with them       so to wrap it up  i wholeheartedly recommended ironhacks web development course      actively participate  ask questions  be engaged  help classmates  keep a positive attitude and this bootcamp will be a life changing event for you as it has been for me         this review is helpful 2     flag as inappropriate              1    2     3     4     5     hellip     next

the world and dipping her toes in graphic design  finance  and entrepreneurship  dafne olca was looking for a career where she would always keep learning  she eventually tried a free coding course  loved it  and decided to enroll in  ironhack s web development bootcamp  in barcelona  spain  taught in english   dafne tells us how learning to code was both very difficult and very satisfying  how supportive  ironhack  was  and still is  for her career  and how much she is enjoying being a front end developer in her new job at   everis    a european consulting firm       q amp a      what s your career and education background  how did your path lead to a bootcamp      my career path has been very diverse so far  i m originally from austria and i did a bachelor s degree in multimedia in london and honolulu  with the aim of working in graphic design and video production  but i found the job opportunities were not the kind of jobs i imagined them to be  then i did an mba in vienna and san diego to increase my career options and ended up in finance in barcelona     after three years  i got bored with finance and wanted to figure out what to do with my life  i had always been interested in technology and worked for a while on a family business focused on the internet of things  i enjoyed researching technologies  philosophical aspects of the business  and looking at the direction in which the world is heading     i eventually came across free code camp and enjoyed it a lot  my friends who work in web development told me if i became a web developer  i would be learning for the rest of my life  at first that sounded intimidating  but it made me realize that s exactly what i want to do with my life   it s a way to make sure i won t get bored  i can keep learning  and getting better at what i do  it goes hand in hand with my personality because i love to learn and do new things  i think that s why web development is the right choice for me      you ve   traveled   a lot   what made you choose ironhack in barcelona  rather than another bootcamp in   a different   city  going back to college  or teaching yourself      i considered teaching myself  but going to university wasn t an option   it was between teaching myself and going to the bootcamp  as a beginner  the best way to change careers was to go full on  and be around professionals   the teachers at ironhack are very talented  and are professionals who have been in the field for a long time     i moved to barcelona three years ago  and fell in love with the city  so it was clear to me that i wanted to do a bootcamp here  i talked to people about the best technologies and languages to learn  and everyone confirmed that ironhack had the best full stack javascript curriculum  barcelona has a good tech atmosphere and a growing startup scene  i d eventually like to have the flexibility to work remotely  and i think that barcelona will allow that     also  the course i did was taught in english  in barcelona  ironhack offers one full time cohort in english  and one full time cohort and one part time cohort in spanish      what was the ironhack application and interview process like for you      the first part was a personality interview to see if you re really genuinely interested in doing the course and pursuing a career in web development  after passing that first interview  i was given some very basic coding exercises  after those exercises  i had a technical interview with a teacher assistant  which i passed before getting accepted into ironhack      what was the learning experience like at ironhack  what was the teaching style      i have to be honest  it was very very tough for me  this was the first time i had done a course in web development  ironhack was split into three modules  first we had the basic front end module  which was pretty doable  the second module was back end  which for me was very difficult  then the final module was back end with the angular framework  which was also demanding     the hours were very intense  officially  the hours are  m to  m  like a full time job  but i don t remember many days when we actually finished at 6  if you re at ironhack  then it s in your best interest to get as much out of the program as you can     the teaching was also quite intense  i m   now so i had been out of school for many years  and going back to lectures was a lot more demanding than i thought it would be  but as intense as it was  it was also very satisfying  your character really shows when you re learning web development   you have to deal with daily frustrations and a lot of challenges  but overcoming those challenges is really rewarding      what was your cohort like      ironhack was one of the most diverse experiences i ve ever had  some of my classmates were   and had come straight out of high school  and the oldest guy was in his late    the average person was somebody who had decided to change their career     we were very international  there were around   students in my class   four of those students were spanish  and the rest of them were from all over the world  including europeans and latin americans      what was your favorite project that you built at ironhack      my favorite project was my first project   i created a game of blackjack with front end javascript  since it was my first project  i felt like i had accomplished something that i never in my life thought i could have accomplished  of course we got help from the teachers  but it s quite impressive to see what you  yourself are capable of doing  before we started the project  i was clueless  i honestly had no idea what i was going to do  how i was going to do it  and i didn t believe i could do it  but after completing the project  it was really impressive to see what i could get myself to do      how did ironhack prepare you for job hunting      when i was researching bootcamps  it was really important for me to be able to land a job as soon as possible  and ironhack pretty much guarantees that almost all alumni who want to find work will find work in the field  right after bootcamp  we had a hiring day where more than   recruiters from tech companies came to the campus to see our work  it was a quick interview where we show them our project  they ask questions  they get to know us  and we get to know the companies     sonia  my careers adviser  was always getting in touch with companies  and getting my input about what i d like to do  on top of that  i thought it was amazing that after i landed a job and needed some guidance  one of the tas still gave me advice and input  even now  i feel like i can go back to ironhack and get support any time i need it  i try not to milk it  but they are just so helpful and so caring      so you ve been working at   everis   for 7 months now  congrats  how did you find the job      everis did come to ironhack for the hiring day  but i didn t get a chance to talk to them because there were so many companies there  so the next day  i contacted them and told them i had missed them  but i wanted to get to know them   i was quite active about reaching out to companies  they replied immediately  i went into the office that same day for an interview  within two weeks  they called me in for a second interview  and shortly after that i received an offer  i was exhausted after graduating from ironhack  so i took a month off over the holidays  but about a month into my job search  i was working at everis      can you tell me about everis and what you work on there       everis  is a consultancy  so we work on projects with different clients  i m a junior front end developer  and i work with angular and typescript  it s a purely front end job  which is what i wanted     i m on my second project since i started at everis  the first project was a web app to help organizations apply for governmental loans  it was a very small  global team   two people in barcelona  two people in zaragoza  spain  and the project manager was based in brussels  belgium  for my current project there are four of us and we re all based in barcelona  except for the project manager who is based in zaragoza     it s a huge company  i think there are about   people in barcelona  and they have branches around the world  the company is very diverse  and the teams are very diverse as well  they have an emphasis on hiring very gender balanced teams  which is nice  everis is definitely more gender balanced than other companies      are you using the technologies and programming languages at everis that you learned at ironhack      i m working in angular  which is a framework we covered in the third module of ironhack  there are always new things to learn in angular  because angular is quite complex and always evolving  so i haven t learned any new languages or frameworks  but i had to learn more about angular on the job     ironhack provided us with the tools to be able to teach ourselves new technologies more easily  in the future  i will inevitably need to learn more languages and frameworks  but now i have the right tools to be able to teach myself a lot more easily than before the bootcamp      since you joined everis  how do you feel you ve grown as a front end developer      in 6 months  i feel like i ve become a lot more independent  and i m less afraid of touching the code  in addition  i ve developed a passion for problems  as weird as that sounds  i enjoy running into problems because i enjoy solving them  it s very fulfilling  honestly  i think ironhack is the best decision i ve made in my life in terms of academia and career development  i haven t regretted it once      how has your background in graphic design  finance  and entrepreneurship been useful in your new job as a front end developer      graphic design is very much about trends  and it s been a long time since i studied it  while there are some aspects of design that still apply  a lot has changed  at everis  when we get a new project  a lot of the design is given by the client   my job is more about implementing the logic and functions rather than the design itself     my experience working in finance has definitely been useful at everis  having experience in a huge corporation definitely helps you work with other people and clients in a professional environment      what s been the biggest challenge or roadblock in your journey to becoming a front end developer      sometimes you can get stuck on a problem for a really long time  and you start having to deal with your own frustrations  the more you get frustrated  the more you block your brain and the less you can really think logically  that s a challenge that i ve had to learn to deal with  and i m really learning how to be calm and patient  i wasn t a patient person before  and i m now really seeing the results of patience      it sounds like ironhack has stayed involved in your career   have you kept in touch with other alumni      i was just at ironhack last week actually and i m going again soon  a lot of people from my cohort have left  but i ve gotten to know people from the cohorts before and after mine  and we ve become quite tight  it s a very strong community  whenever ironhack hosts events  i prioritize them   it s a very good atmosphere and a great network  and every time i go there i feel like i m at home      what advice do you have for people making a career change through a coding bootcamp      just do it  my best advice is to stay calm and be aware that you re going to reach your mental limits  you re going to have a hard time  but it s really worth it and it s very rewarding  there are going to be times when you ll want to feel very stupid   don t  if you can be a master of your emotions  then you have a good path ahead      find out more and read  ironhack reviews  on

lauren stewart    3        ironhack              berlin is proving to be an incredible tech ecosystem   with campuses in miami  madrid  paris  mexico and barcelona   ironhack  is launching their web development   bootcamp   in berlin  germany in   to take advantage of the growing tech scene  we spoke with  ironhack  s emea expansion lead  alvaro rojas  about the berlin campus at a wework space  how ironhack is recruiting lots of local hiring partners  and what sort of jobs ironhack graduates can expect to get in berlin  plus  as an ironhack grad himself  alvaro gives advice on where to start as a new coder       q amp a      what s your background and how did you get involved with ironhack      my background is in strategy consulting  i studied business in london  and then i worked in strategic consulting for tech startups in spain and california  i worked for the embassy of spain in los angeles for a little while  and then i launched my own venture there     i m actually an ironhack graduate  working in the tech industry  i had always been interested in learning how to code  so i did some research online and i found ironhack  i graduated from ironhack around a year and a half ago     i fell in love with the company s mission and the community they were creating  you hear some really incredible stories when you re working with people from such diverse backgrounds  after graduating  i kept in touch with  gonzalo manrique   one of the co founders  so when they decided to expand in europe  he contacted me about the emea  europe  middle eastern  and africa  expansion lead position  it was a no brainer for me      did you attend ironhack to become a developer or did you just want to pick up coding skills      i wanted to pick up coding skills  i think everybody in the future should become literate in some kind of coding language  even if you re not planning on working as a developer  most jobs in the future will require a basic knowledge of programming  and i wanted to stay ahead of the curve  if you work in tech  understanding how software is built is a must  regardless of your position  eventually  machines will dominate the world and you ll have to speak their language      you have this unique perspective of actually being a student before working as staff at ironhack      absolutely  it s easier for me to explain the benefits behind ironhack because i ve lived through the whole experience  it s really great when we do events and prospective students ask me about ironhack  the first thing i tell them is   look  i m an alum  i went through the whole experience  i can tell you everything you need to know  and everything you ll go through   it was definitely one of the most challenging and rewarding times in my life      tell us about your role at ironhack      the first step when i started was working with the co founders and the vp of ops  amp  expansion  alex berriche  to make a strategy plan for europe  we had various cities in mind and decided to take a structured approach and rank them according to factors we know to be determinants for success  we finally decided berlin was clearly the next step for us     after deciding on a city  i move there to set everything up  there are two main areas i m responsible for  the first is operations  amp  hr   setting up the legal entity for ironhack s new campus  securing financing for our students etc  and getting together a dream team to run the campus     the second key area is marketing  we tailor our strategy to each market  it s all about understanding the different customer segments and building brand awareness   once people understand our value proposition they re always convinced  we focus strongly on partnering up with cool companies like   or moberries  and doing free workshops and events for prospective students  it s all about getting people excited about learning new digital skills     our first cohort in berlin launches may           what stood out about berlin  germany  why is this city a great place for ironhack to have a campus      ironhack already has campuses in europe   madrid  barcelona  and paris   so we want to continue to be present in the strongest tech ecosystems  and berlin is proving to be an incredible tech ecosystem  berlin is home to the single largest software market in europe   that s around a quarter of the european market by value  which is pretty crazy  there are around 2   to 2   active tech startups here  including some really disruptive companies  the tech ecosystem is booming  and the city has the ability to attract and retain talented people like no other place  people are flocking to berlin because they like living here and there s plenty of job opportunities     also  the it jobs market in germany has a growing digital skills gap  there are a lot of new startups that demand developers and designers  along with traditional older companies who are going through a digitalization process   mckinsey released a study  saying there would be     digital jobs in berlin by    so that was big data point for us      since students can go to university for free in berlin  why would they want to pay to go to ironhack      companies are demanding more people with digital skills  and four year universities just can t cater to that market  ironhack believes universities  regardless of whether they are private or public  are failing to adapt to the digital revolution  the university approach hasn t changed in   years  and getting a job in this day and age requires a different  updated approach     ironhack provides high impact  condensed educational experiences with one objective in mind   getting students from zero to job ready in three months  because of this  we believe there will always be a gap in the market where we can provide value  regardless  we are working hard to make it easier for students to have access to our programs by providing financing options through both private and public channels      what will make ironhack stand out amongst the competition in berlin      we are laser focused on one objective  enabling students to secure a job within three months after graduation     so how do we achieve that  well  first we make our students employable  we constantly update our curriculum to ensure we teach the latest technologies that employers actually demand  and we hire professional instructors with real world experience to teach them  we provide career guidance and support throughout the whole program  and students are prepared for technical interviews  behavioral interviews  etc  we believe in learning by doing  so students come out with three projects to show to the world once they ve graduated     we also focus on giving our students access to those opportunities  by securing hiring partners and organizing a career week where students get to meet prospective employers at the end of each cohort      what types of applicants are you looking to enroll in the berlin campus      we re looking for career changers  there are so many talented people in berlin who have moved here looking for opportunities  ironhack gives you the possibility to specialize and land a job in three months  we cater to anyone who realizes the importance of learning new digital skills and has a passion to learn      how many students does ironhack plan to accommodate at the berlin campus      we re going to have three cohorts in    the first one starts in may  the second one in july and the third one in october  for the first cohort  we re looking at about   students  we don t like to have cohorts much bigger than that because we want to guarantee quality  moving forward we will look to grow our team and number of cohorts  always ensuring students have the best possible experience      how do you source new instructors  what will be the instructor  student ratio      we hire real professionals who have worked in the tech industry  our lead instructor for berlin was working at the ironhack paris campus as the lead instructor for a year and he wanted to move to berlin  he s one of those people who has been coding his whole life  he started his own company  and he s worked in the industry as a lead developer   he has a very impressive background  and he already knows the ironhack bootcamp and our course  so that s always a plus     at ironhack  a lead instructor leads the whole program  and then we have teaching assistants  who are also coding professionals  for every eight students  to provide support and guide students through the course  for example  in the first cohort  if we have   students  we would have one lead instructor and two or three teaching assistants  having gone through the bootcamp myself  i feel the teaching assistants play an incredibly important role because they provide valuable assistance throughout the whole bootcamp      will the curriculum at ironhack berlin be the same as other ironhack campuses      ironhack s current curriculum is divided into three modules  front end  html  css  amp  javascript   backend mean stack  and microservices with angular 2  api s   we are always looking to make our curriculum better  we were teaching ruby on rails  but we decided to move on to   also  something i always tell prospective students is that you learn how to learn  i graduated from the ruby on rails course and was able to learn node js on my own just the next month     we re in contact with a lot of startups  so we make sure our curriculum is exactly what employers need and demand  we make a point to keep the curriculum consistent across all campuses  this allows us to have a feedback loop at every campus and ensure consistent quality  so we re sticking with the same curriculum in every campus for now  but always looking to iterate and make it better      tell us about the berlin campus  what is the classroom like      as with most of our new campuses  we ll be located at a wework co working space  a new building called atrium tower right on potsdamer platz  the space itself is a big room which holds around   students  when we visited the space about a month and a half ago  we fell in love with the facilities  the campus is accessible from anywhere in town because of its central location  and it has an incredible terrace at the top     when you re going to be learning for three months in an incredibly intense program  being in a nice space with amenities   coffee  snacks  really nice views   is something really important      what are some examples of the types of jobs you envision your berlin graduates landing after   bootcamp        we have a very strong reputation worldwide  with a global community of alumni and partners  for example  we just signed up    a mobile bank to be our hiring partner  we re in talks with several berlin companies to sign them up as hiring partners too  at the end of each nine week course  we prepare prospective employers to meet with the students  like i said  we re very focused on career changers and ensuring our students get a job within three months after graduation     in the past  we ve had companies like google  twitter  visa  rocket internet  and magic leap hire ironhack graduates  so in berlin we re looking for the same profiles  those are global companies we already have partnerships with  so our students already have access to that pool of employers  then locally  we are looking for the most disruptive companies that are ready to hire entry level junior developers      do you envision berlin grads staying in berlin  is your focus to get people hired in the city where they studied      we have a big focus on having a global community  so we really like the idea that our students can access all the communities in all our cities  for example  i recently passed on the resumes of two graduates from the madrid ux ui course to berlin based    it s up to each graduate to decide which city to work in     a lot of people want to stay in their home city and others don t  so we cater to both  we try to give opportunities to go abroad  and options to work in the local market      what would you recommend a complete beginner do to learn more about the tech scene in berlin      i would recommend going to as many meetups and events as you can  i always tell people that you never know what opportunities could arise if you put yourself out there  and start talking to people  we actually just wrote a blog post about  how to land the tech job in berlin   and one piece of advice is to mingle  just network     then  of course  i would recommend going to the ironhack meetups  there are a bunch of workshops in berlin and our informal network is huge   we re doing one free workshop every week  and we ll do some bigger events as well      what advice do you have for someone who s thinking about attending a coding   bootcamp   in berlin and considering ironhack      form my experience as an alum  i think it s all about the attitude  when you go into a coding bootcamp  there s always this feeling where you re a little bit scared because it is something really demanding  people have a natural tendency to be resistant to learn something so technical  but just start coding  it s not as difficult as it may seem  and having the right guidance is key  we re actually launching a cool challenge in berlin    a free online course  to encourage people to get their feet wet with coding     a lot more people than we believe have the aptitude for it  and actually become really good programmers  you just have to take a leap of faith and commit to three months of very intense work  we have a    placement rate and while we do have a rigorous admissions process  the majority of our students get hired  i recommend people to just go for it  i can guarantee that if you have the right attitude  you ll succeed      find out more about

      we spoke with  ironhack  s vp of operations  amp  expansion  alexandre berriche  to learn about the mexico city tech ecosystem and why there is a growing demand for developers in the area  this school uses feedback from their campuses around the world to continually improve the curriculum  discover how  ironhack  can connect you to a    network of alumni  help you with job placement  and get some tips for your application        q amp a       what s your background  what drew you to want to work with ironhack      after starting my career in private equity  i joined jumia a rocket internet company  also called the african amazon  i was head of operations in north africa and then managing director of tunisia i got in touch with ariel and gonzalo  the founders of ironhack  and was really inspired by their vision  also  since i actually attended a coding bootcamp myself  i was excited to come and work in this industry  i saw the great potential the bootcamp model had in europe and also latin america  i was keen to have an impact on people s lives  so i was super receptive to our conversation and working with ironhack  it was a great fit      as the vp of expansion  can you describe your role      as vp of expansion  i work with the founders to create a strategy and decide which markets make sense for us to open in next  then i m involved with the operations preparation where i actually launch the new markets     there are three main areas to consider when launching in a new market  the first is human resources   we want to build an awesome team including a general manager  we were super excited to find a great gm for our mexico campus  marketing and brand awareness is number two  when you re launching in a new market  you want to increase the brand awareness and convince your first students of the benefits of the new campus  it can be difficult in a new market because we are starting from scratch  so we have to leverage the use of marketing channels such as public relations  events  and partnerships to integrate ourselves into the local ecosystem  the third area is legal   making sure the legal administration is completed  if you succeed in those three areas  you are ready to open in any market      what stood out about mexico city  why did ironhack choose to open a campus there      we are one of the leaders in the coding bootcamp industry globally  and we ve been thinking about opening in latin america for quite some time  latin america is a great market because there is so much demand for tech skills  but there is a limited number of established bootcamps in the area  in   it is estimated there will be a deficit of     it jobs in mexico  so we can have a great impact on that  we want to train the new generation of technology professionals to join the industry  not many  if any  bootcamps have campuses in the u s   europe  and in latin america  so latin america was very attractive to us     mexico city was the preferred choice because it has a booming tech ecosystem  it s one of the largest markets for startups  mexico city is the entry for many tech companies moving to latin america   facebook  amazon  and so on   so many tech multinationals are moving in   the ecosystem is not just booming  it s also maturing significantly well as there are plenty of vc s  accelerators  and company builders     finally  it s a pretty friendly environment for internet technology and computer science  it s a big market to penetrate  but it s less difficult than some other markets because there are no global competitors  there are obviously some local competitors  whom we respect a lot  but we are going to give the mexico city ecosystem access to ironhack s global community which is already present in miami  paris  barcelona  and madrid  we think building ties within those markets will excite students learning in mexico city      there are only a few   bootcamps   in mexico city  how will ironhack stand out once other   bootcamps   start to pop up      ironhack will stand out because we are global  we have already learned so much about running a bootcamp  because each market we operate in has different standards and different challenges  so by bringing this experience into the market  we are raising the coding bootcamp standards for mexico city  ironhack has graduated 1   students  so we have a large community  we have alumni working for amazon  google  and ibm  which is a big plus  we have great reviews on course report  and we have great student satisfaction for our curriculum  over the four years we have been operating  we have continued to improve our teaching methods      what is the ironhack mexico city campus like      our offices are at the wework insurgentes coworking space  and it s amazing to work alongside different mexico city startups and see how dynamic the space is  it s super exciting  we re in the colonia napoles  which is like a district of startups  at wework we take up two rooms of   x   feet each which hold between   to   students  we will start with one class  and then eventually have two classes rolling at the same time   one ux ui design course  and one web development course     our objective at ironhack is not quantitative  it s more qualitative so we are not going to accept students if they don t have the required technical level  we are selective with students and we don t accept everyone      could you describe the ironhack application process  is it the same across campuses      yes  we have two interviews   one personal interview and one technical interview  you can make it through the technical interview even if you don t have tons of knowledge  but you must be a hard worker  if you prepare your case  you can make it in  but we want to be selective     before the bootcamp starts we also have pre work and the objective is to have everyone at the same knowledge level when we start the course  people are spending a lot of time and money to really improve  so the courses are very intensive for that reason      ironhack teaches ux ui design and web development  will you be teaching the same curriculum in mexico city      we collect feedback in each market  and with each piece of feedback we receive  we improve our curriculum little by little  we trust and use the same curriculum in every market  you can t scale efficiently if you have each market doing different classes  the feedback loops in all the different markets allow us to have the best quality program  i don t think we could have the best quality if we made too many specificities for the various cities      how many instructors will you have at the mexico city campus      the number of instructors will grow as the number of students and the number of classes increase  for instance  at the paris campus  four months after launching we had seven teachers  it will be the same for mexico  so we ll start with one instructor and then after a few months  seven  and after one year maybe     we re going to see how fast it grows      since ironhack is a global   bootcamp    how do you help with the job search and placement  what sort of jobs do you expect graduates to get      we are trying to build partnerships with linio  tip  and many mexican startups where we can place our students  companies will be invited to hiring week at the end of the bootcamp to see what type of talent we produce  we ll start by targeting companies in mexico city and then we ll expand and make partnerships with companies in guadalajara and monterrey as a second step     most of our graduates become junior developers  we have less entrepreneurs and more junior developers  ironhack focuses on career changers and trying to help them to achieve their ambitions so that s why we are so focused on placement with iron week  and a placement manager in each market      is it pretty normal for graduates to stay in the city where they studied      we are seeing graduates stay in the city where they studied  unless they re coming from abroad  we have a few international students and currently  most of them go to the barcelona and paris campuses  we don t know about mexico city graduates yet  but most of our applications so far are from mexico   with some international applicants as well      if someone is a beginner and thinking about attending a coding bootcamp in mexico city like ironhack  do you have any meetup or event suggestions      yes  ironhack is doing  a huge full day event at wework on december  h   anyone can attend and it s free

experience  it s a once in a lifetime experience to spend nine weeks changing your career  you will learn so much  meet new companies  and get hired  if you want to learn more   go to the ironhack

ironhack          ironhack  is a global web development   bootcamp   with locations in madrid  miami  barcelona  and now paris  we spoke with  ironhack  s general manager for france  franois   fillette    to learn more about their new paris campus  launching june  h  france is the second largest tech ecosystem in europe   learn why ironhack chose to expand to the area  read how the   bootcamp   will stand out from the rest  and see what resources are available to become a successful   bootcamp   grad in paris       first  as the france general manager  tell me how you ve been involved with the new ironhack campus      sure  as a general manager  i have been involved in all the dimensions related to the new campus   finding an amazing place for our students  recruiting a team of a players  setting up the docs and processes and so on  i have been working with alex  our head of international expansion  who has been tremendously helpful  we have worked super hard over the last few weeks to make sure that our paris campus will be on the same standards as the others      what s your background and how did you get involved with   bootcamps    what drew you to want to work with ironhack      i was coming back from san francisco  where i was working as vp of strategy and business development for  codingame   one of my vc friends told me that ariel and gonzalo  the cofounders  were looking for someone to launch ironhack in france  i met the two of them and immediately embraced their vision  and got impressed by their ability to execute fast and well  i got super excited by the project and the team  so a couple of days later i was in miami to work on the strategy and the launch plan for france  it s been 3 months now and honestly  i ve never been happier to wake up in the morning and start a new day      ironhack is launching their paris campus on june  h  why is paris a great place for a coding   bootcamp    could you explain ironhack s motivation to expand there      in terms of funding  france is now the  d largest tech ecosystem in europe  right after england  over the last 5 years  it has grown exponentially and is now one of the key tech hubs in the world  take  station f  for instance   thanks to xavier niel  cofounder of free   paris will now have the biggest incubator in the world  that growth has fueled an increasing demand for new skills in the tech economy and the talent shortage is not filled by the traditional education players  there s an amazing opportunity for us to expand here and we ll do everything we can to reach our targets      there are a few other coding   bootcamps   in paris  what will make ironhack stand out amongst the competition      several initiatives and players have appeared over the last couple of years  which shows you how dynamic the market is  i think 3 elements will set ironhack apart from the competition  first  our courses are focused on the latest technologies   for example  full stack javascript for web development   and we constantly iterate to improve both the content and the academic experience  then  we dedicate a large share of the course        to hands on  real life applications  students work on real projects  submitted by partners or by themselves if they want to create their startup business  last  we help with the placement of our students if they re looking for a job  coaching for technical and behavioral interviews  connections to companies startups  events  etc    we have an average placement rate of    after 3 months across our campuses      let s discuss the paris campus  what is the classroom like  what neighborhood is it in      the campus is located in the new space opened by wework  it is located in the  h arrondissement  near the paris opera  it is accessible via 3 metro lines  8 bus lines  2 bike sharing stations  and 2 car sharing stations  it will be open   7 for our students     the place is absolutely magnificent  both in terms of design and community  students will enjoy a large classroom close to the patio  and meeting working rooms to complete their projects and assignments      what web development and ux ui design tracks or languages are you teaching at this campus and why  are the ones you ve chosen particularly popular or relevant in paris      the core curriculum is the same across the different campuses to make sure students have the same academic experience and that we have a strong expertise in our area  then we tailor the mentors  the events and the projects to the local specificities of the students and of the ecosystem  so  for web development  we ll be focusing on full stack javascript but we ll be integrating events and mentors around frameworks really popular here  ex  react or meteor  and industries that are the rising trends  ex  online media and entertainment       how many instructors and or mentors will you have in paris      we ll have a lead instructor  who is a professional developer and highly involved in the open source community  he has several years of experience in startups and it services agencies  he ll be assisted by a ta  who is a bit more junior  but passionate about education and teaching students  plus  we ll have a network of     mentors to help and coach students  for coding as well as for management  mentors will be chosen based on the projects of the students  also  the students of the first web development session will be sponsored by florian jourda  florian was the  t engineer at box and scaled their dev team from 2 to   people  he spent 8 years in the silicon valley and is now chief product officer at bayes impact  an ngo funded by google that uses machine learning to solve social problems like unemployment      how many students do you usually have in a cohort  how many can you accommodate      for that first cohort  we plan to have   students maximum because we want to make sure we provide the best experience  that will ensure a strong monitoring of students  as well as a perfect operational execution on our side  for the next cohorts  we ll increase the number of students  but we won t go above   and we ll recruit 1 or 2 more tas to keep the same quality        what kind of hours will students need to put in to be successful      students often ask that question and it s always hard to answer  everything depends on their learning curve  on average  students work between   to   hours a week  mainly on projects and assignments  but we re fully transparent on this   you can t learn real hard skills and get a job in 3 months without fully dedicating yourself  we make sure that the atmosphere is as good as it can be so that students won t see time passing by      how is your campus similar or different to the other ironhack campuses      i think that our campus is pretty similar to miami s  we are located in an amazing coworking space  in a very nice neighborhood and with lots of startups around  the main difference would be our rooftop on the  h floor of the building  where we regularly organize events and lunches      how are you approaching job placement in a new city  does ironhack have an employer network already      job placement is one of the elements we tailor to the local realities and needs  we have already partnered with    tech companies  such as drivy  world leader in peer to peer car rental   jumia  the equivalent of amazon in africa and middle east   stootie  europe leader in peer to peer services   kima ventures  vc fund of xavier niel  with    portfolio companies   etc  usually  they are large startups  from series a to series d  looking to hire web developers  as a gm  it will be part of my job to support and help students accomplish their professional projects with our employer partners      what types of companies are hiring developers in paris and why types of companies do you expect to hire from ironhack s paris campus      i think there are 3 types of companies that could hire web developers who graduated from ironhack   corporations in telecom media technology  startups  from series a to series d  and it services companies  the demand is really intense for the last two options  as they re looking for people mastering the latest technologies  in high volumes  based on the enthusiasm they ve expressed when talking with ironhack  we know they ll be great recruiting partners        what sort of jobs have you seen graduates get at other ironhack campuses and what do you expect for ironhack paris graduates  do they usually stay in the city after graduation      based on the metrics of other campuses  usually       of people join a startup as an employee  a junior web developer  project manager or growth hacker        create their own startup after the course  while      become freelancers  usually in web development  and work on a remote basis  we ll have a good share of students who are not from france originally  so we think some of them might leave paris after the course  but we ll help them find the right opportunity abroad and we ll keep constant interaction with those students      what meetups or resources would you recommend for a complete beginner in paris who wants to get started      france has some great players in the field  if you want to get an intro to javascript  i would recommend you visit openclassrooms  codecademy or codecombat  then  in terms of meetups  the family and numa are two accelerators with outstanding weekly events  some of them are related to one specific coding topic and they re usually apprehended at a beginner level      any final thoughts that you d like our readers to know about ironhack paris      we want to build something that is nothing like what exists in paris  in 3 months  you ll be operational in web development  you ll meet awesome people  students  mentors  entrepreneurs  and you ll accomplish your professional project  send us an email to know more at  paris ironhack com   we have a few seats left for the session starting on june  h  next session will start on september  h  if you want to apply  just send us your application through this

 instructor spotlight  jacqueline pastore of ironhack      liz eggleston             ironhack           miami coding bootcamp  ironhack  recently launched an intensive course in ux ui design  where students learn everything they need to know about user research  rapid prototyping  user testing  and front end web development to land their first job in ux design  we sat down with instructor  and ux superstar  jacqueline pastore on their first day of class to find out what makes a great ux ui designer  think  listening skills  empathy and communication   how the school produces user experience unicorns by incorporating html bootstrap skills into the curriculum  and the teaching style that future students can expect at  ironhack miami        q amp a      how did you become a successful ux designer  did you get a degree in  ux design       i m a career changer  my background was first in film and creative writing  and i worked in the film industry in miami before i ended up in boston  temping as a project manager for a venture capital company with an incubator focused on harvard and mit startups  i learned from really smart people about computers  software  graphic design  and project management  and ibm had their lotus notes usability labs next door  so i got to participate as a usability tester  i went back to grad school at bentley university for my masters in human factors in information design  and had a magical career doing ethnography and user research at microsoft  staples  adidas  and reebok  and ux design for fidelity investments  staples  the federal reserve  jp morgan chase  h amp r block  novartis pharmaceuticals  and zumba fitness     two years ago  i moved back to miami and started my own product   ux gofer   which is a ux research tool      after spending years learning user experience and even getting a masters degree  why do you believe in the bootcamp model as an effective way to learn ux design      i went through my grad program very quickly  in one year   so i believe that you can learn this material very quickly and then continue learning on the job  that s exactly why i ve had a successful career  by specifically going after different verticals  technologies  and platforms  if i hadn t used something before  i wanted to try it  i believe that you can learn the fundamentals quickly and then refine them throughout your career      what made you excited to work at ironhack in particular  what stands out about ironhack to you as a professional ux designer      it was the people  i was referred to ironhack by someone i ve respected in the industry for years  and they were right  the people running ironhack are what convinced me to work on this ux bootcamp      did you have teaching experience prior to teaching at the bootcamp  what is different about teaching at a coding bootcamp      i teach now at the university of miami  at conferences  and bootcamps  at ironhack  my personal teaching style is to lecture very little  and focus on hands on work  it s important to know the foundations and principles and science behind what we do  but at the end of the day  you have to deliver  so we spend the majority of our days doing activities  which means running surveys  doing interviews  running usability tests  designing products  i think it s so important for students to create their portfolio pieces throughout the bootcamp  instead of just having one portfolio project at the end of the course  for someone breaking into the ux community  the portfolio is how students demonstrate their knowledge and how they approach projects           this is ironhack s first foray into ux ui design courses  tell us about the curriculum      marcelo paiva and i created the ironhack curriculum based on what we would have wanted to learn in a bootcamp if we were to just get started in this field  we follow the user and product development lifecycles to make sure that our students have all the skills they need to be useful right now in the current marketplace     we start with  user research    how to talk to your target market  the methodology behind that research  what to do with that data  deliverables  and turning that data into concept design     we move into  information architecture and interaction design   with low fidelity all the way into high fidelity  and micro interaction models  we use invision  sketch  and principal as the tools for that piece of the curriculum  then we move into  visual   design  for mobile and web  because they are two different beasts     then we move into  front end development   where students learn how to implement the designs they re creating  this is what the industry is looking for right now  the unicorns that can do the html and bootstrap to implement their own designs  that will make ironhack students really effective and marketable     finally  we move into  individual projects   ironhack students are building portfolio pieces from day one  but towards the end of the course  they work on more specific projects and breakouts for additional topics that we haven t covered yet     i m so super excited about this bootcamp and i think it s really valuable      is the push for designers to learn to code the biggest trend   in   the ux ui field right now      it depends on where our graduates choose to work  as part of a smaller team  a ux designer will have to be more of a generalist  and need to do research  design  and development  if they re working for a larger organization  they can specialize in a particular field within ux like ethnography  or mobile design  or design thinking  as a whole  i think careers in the ux community are becoming both broader and more specialized  the ux community is both coming together and breaking into niches      how many instructors    tas    and or mentors do you have  is there an ideal student teacher ratio      the student teacher ratio for the ux ui course is   1  many of the required activities are tackled in groups among the students in groups of 3 or 4  as the principal instructor  i lead and teach the main flow of the course  and we have subject matter experts and mentors come in to teach sections of the curriculum that are more specialized e g  design thinking  front end development  etc      can you tell us a little bit about the ideal student for ironhack s ux ui design bootcamp  what s your class like right now  and how do the ux students differ from the coding bootcamp students      the ideal student for the ux ui design bootcamp is someone who possesses strong communication skills  can use empathy to jump into other people s shoes  and has a passion for user experience  the current class is a wonderful mix of many professional backgrounds  for example  some profiles include a former marketing manager for sony music  a research director from the non profit space  and an mba grad looking to use their previous business process skills to crack into the ux sector           this is a full time bootcamp  but how many hours a week do you expect your students to commit to ironhack miami      in addition to the daily schedule of  m to  m  we expect students to spend approximately   hours outside of class time to work on assignments and projects  so about    hours week      in a ux bootcamp  is the style largely project based  can you give us an example      yes  students will work on 2 projects during the first 6 weeks  one individual project and one group project   these projects are a sum of the individual units we cover on a week by week basis  the capstone of the course is a 2 week final project that each student completes individually  as they go through the entire user and product development lifecycles  the result at the end of the course is that each student has 3 prototypes that they can use as portfolio pieces moving forward      what s the goal for a student that graduates from ironhack  in terms of career and ability   for example  will they be prepared for a junior ux ui role  a senior role      the goal of this course is to provide students the skills to carry out a ux ui design process from beginning to end in multiple circumstances with varying goals  as a result  students will be prepared for junior and entry level roles in ux ui fields  depending on which part of that process most interests them      for our readers who are beginners  what resources or meetups do you recommend for aspiring bootcampers in miami      we hold open houses and free introductory workshops to coding

miami      liz eggleston    9 2      ironhack           ironhack is an immersive ios and web development bootcamp that started in spain and has now expanded to miami  with a hiring network and  happy alumni   ironhack is a great florida bootcamp option  but what exactly does it take to get into ironhack  we caught up with the ironhack team to learn everything  you  need to know about the ironhack application and interview process  including how long it will take  their current acceptance rate  and a sneak peek at the questions you ll hear in the interview        the application      how long does the ironhack application typically take      the ironhack application process falls into 3 stages  the written application  first interview  and second technical interview  and takes on average      days to complete in entirety      what goes into the written application  does ironhack require a video submission      the written application is a chance for students to give a quick summary of their background and motivations for wanting to attend  it s their opportunity to tell us about themselves in a nutshell and peak the admission committee s interest      what types of backgrounds have successful ironhack students had  does everyone come from a technical background      we are impressed and inspired by the diversity of students that ironhack attracts  we ve had former flight attendants  world travelling yoginis  and cs grads from ivy leagues all attend ironhack  we ve been amazed at how coding is so democratic and attracts all sorts of people  regardless of educational background or pedigree  those who tend to perform the best at ironhack are those who have committed to doing so  not necessarily those with a technical background           the interview      can you give us a sample question from the  first interview        what motivates you on a day to day basis and what do you love to do       can you give us a sample question from the  technical interview        what happens when you put a function inside a loop       what are a few resources that you suggest applicants use to really ace the technical interview      when an applicant is in the midst of our process  we actually send them materials specifically to prepare for the technical interview and set office hours with our teaching assistants  so they can get some one on one time to address specific questions  apart from that  if they already have some experience programming   https   autotelicum github io smooth coffeescript literate js intro html   we recommend this resource for complete beginners  javascript for cats   http   jsforcats com       how do you evaluate an applicant s future potential  what qualities are you looking for      ironhack s application process reveals a lot of qualities in potential candidates because it is a bit longer than most coding schools  the advantage of this is  it allows us to see how candidates and applicants respond to learning material in a short amount of time  and how dedicated they are to their goals  if they can t even complete the interview process  it s an indicator that they might not have the passion or drive to get through 8 weeks of a coding bootcamp  we look for curiosity  passion  and drive  drive is probably the most important quality to succeed at ironhack           is there a technical coding challenge in the ironhack application      yes      how long should it take  is there a time limit      we give our students exactly 7 days to prepare for the technical interview after the  t interview and provide the materials they need to prep for it  the technical interview is led by one of our miami instructors and consists of a coding challenge that the applicant has   minutes to solve      can an applicant complete the coding challenge in any programming language      the applicant can complete the challenge in whatever programming language they feel most comfortable in as long as that language can solve a breadth of problems  that means that something like css is out      getting accepted      what is the current acceptance rate at ironhack      as of now  our current acceptance rate is        5   to be exact       are students accepted on a rolling basis      yes  spots fill up quickly  so the sooner the applicant gets started  the better      does ironhack miami have a lot of international students since your roots are in spain  do international students get student visas tourist visas to do the program      yes  we have more than   countries represented in our bootcamps globally  e g  thailand  pakistan  germany  france  brazil  etc   the majority of our students who travel to miami from abroad use a tourist visa to visit the us and attend our program  we love the melting pot of miami combined with ironhack s reputation globally  it s really a fun place to learn and study           want to learn more about ironhack  check out  their website         have

application process  the project he created during the course  and how ironhack helped him nail a job as an ios developer at rushmore fm            what were you doing before you started at ironhack      i was a freelancer for a year  focused on web front end development  i worked at an agency before  also for a year  in terms of education  i didn t study anything related to computer science before ironhack           did you have a technical background before you applied       i ve been developing since i was    and all that i know is self taught  and not in any concrete platform  but having projects of my own where the need of learning more every time drove me to get them done           why did you choose ironhack  did you apply to any other bootcamps       i chose ironhack basically because it took very good advantage of google adwords so i could not avoid reaching its website and getting interested on it  they offered me a merit scholarship so i finally made the decision  i have never applied to anything like ironhack           what was the application process like       the application process was good  the interviews were more of culture fit and they were not much separated in time with each other  so it took less than a month to have it all approved           what was your cohort like  did you find diversity in age  gender etc       it was quite good for me  there was clear diversity in age  but not in gender at all  as we were just men  about the level  it was not as fair is it should ve been  but in general the class was able to follow the course s process           who were your instructors  what was the teaching style like and how did it work with your learning style      there were many instructors  so trying to give feedback about all of them would be endless  the teaching style was agile  asking for feedback continuously and adapting the course to it  so it made the experience really enriching  i ve never had a teaching style like this before and it really fit with me           did you ever experience burnout  how did you push through it       i did not really experience burnout  but there was a week  when we learned about using core data  that i got really tired because it was boring to me  it was the  ugly  side of ios development  but the professor was so good that i got it all and learned a lot those 5 days           can you tell us about a time when you were challenged in the class  how did you succeed    for me the challenge was not in a concrete situation  but in following the course s speed  it was the first time for me to need to learn so fast and so much           tell us about a project you re proud of that you made during ironhack       i m currently working on an app  which is the one i started at ironhack as the final project  but i didn t have time enough to finish it  so i m still developing it in collaboration with my partner  who is a graphic designer and the one who designed the app  i will provide links as soon as it is released  it is called snapreminder  stay tuned              what are you up to today  where are you working and what does your job entail       i m working at rushmore fm as a lead ios developer  building the new application we ll be releasing soon  i m currently the only ios developer  but i ll lead the team when it grows  i got this job because they contacted me directly           did you feel like ironhack prepared you to get a job in the real world       it totally prepared me for a real world job  it was worth the money for me  i don t regret at all           have you continued your education after you graduated       not formally  but i keep learning every day and trying to enrich myself            want to learn more about ironhack  check out their  school page

learn coding skills  so he enrolled in  ironhack   a coding bootcamp in madrid  with locations in miami and barcelona   jaime tells us why he chose ironhack  the technical  and  soft skills he learned in his course and the mentors who have helped him along the way            what were you up to before deciding to enroll in ironhack  did you have a technical background before applying        before being a programmer  i was project manager in a big it company  i hired programmers  and managed their work  after some time i began to be more and more interested in the work those programmers were doing  so much that i decided to quit my job and learn to code  i did a master s degree of   hours in cice  a it school in madrid  with the great luck to have an amazing teacher called  devta singh   i learned much more than just coding from him  he showed me how to face the problem  find the better solution  and how to succeed on it  it was a personal revelation  and since this moment i knew that i wanted to be a programmer      after the degree i started to work in a digital advertising company called the fact  we worked for traditional offline advertising companies they needed digital development for his clients  i improved my php and javascript skills there during almost 2 years  but i had the feeling i wasn t improving faster enough  i tried to look for something new to stimulate myself and began to teach coding in a it academy from madrid called trazos  but i needed a change to keep pushing my skills  that s why i turned to ironhack           was ironhack the only bootcamp you applied to  what about ironhack convinced you to go there  the languages they taught  instructors  price etc         ironhack was my first and last choice  honestly  i didn t knew many bootcamps  but the main reason were the instructors and the great professionals they talked very good about the course  many of the coders i admire like  keyvan akbary  or  carlos bl  were involved and interested on the bootcamp  this was enough to make the choice            can you talk about a time when you got stuck in the class and how you pushed through       fortunately i did not got stuck a lot in class  but when i did not understood something i asked for more explanations and i received it immediately and solved the problem            what were your classmates and instructors like         they were all amazing  i guess i was very very very lucky on that point  because all my classmates were amazing  not only because they were friendly  they really were   but because they were skilled and interested to push like i was   it s amazing when you share such experience with people they think and like the same thinks like you  because it pushed the level very high   the instructors were also great  very friendly and open to discuss or try whatever we asked for  i think they can t imagine how thankful i am   but not only with the teachers or students  also with ironhack s staff  they did everything possible to make us receive what we needed           tell us about your final project  what does it do  what technologies did you use  how long did it take  etc        for my final project i used ruby on rails  postgresql  html  css and javascript   to develop a online medical appointments application  it took a week to have something working and able to be shown in the demo day           what are you working on now  do you have a job as a developer  what does it entail        i m working now in marketgoo com  a website marketing and seo online  do it yourself  tool   as full stack developer  i use php  mysql  html5  less  phinx  phpactiverecord  javascript and other technologies every day  but the key is that i m not only a developer there  i m also involved in the product management  collaborating every day in decisions about the product  his look and feel  his behavior and the business itself           would you have been able to learn what you now know without ironhack        maybe i could be able to learn the technical part  but there is no way to learn it in 2 months without a bootcamp  it s just too much information to handle it alone   besides  there is much more than the technical knowledge that you receive in ironhack  you also get a lot of contacts  friends  experience  knowhow and the most important thing  a perspective of what you don t know yet           want to learn more about ironhack  check out their  school page  on course report or  their website here   want to catch up with jaime  read  his blog  or follow him on  twitter             student spotlight  marta fonda  ironhack      liz eggleston    7        ironhack           marta fonda needed to improve her web development skills in order to compete for jobs at her dream companies  so she enrolled in  ironhack   an 8 week intensive programming course for developers and entrepreneurs  we talk to marta about how she succeeded in the class and got a job as a front end engineer at floqq com       what were you up to before deciding to enroll in ironhack  did you have a technical background before applying       when i decided to enroll in ironhack i had just finished my degrees in software engineering and business administration  when i finished my studies i realized that my background in mobile and web development was not enough  so i was looking for an opportunity in a company that would bet on me     i m a very motivated person and  in fact  i interviewed with companies like google and ibm but i did not have enough experience  it was around that time that i found ironhack bootcamp and i decided to try it     i had technical background as a software engineer but most of my experience programming was based on languages such c  java or sql  i needed to improve my skills in order to become a better developer           was ironhack the only bootcamp you applied to  what about ironhack convinced you to go there      this was the only bootcamp i applied to and the main reason was that they were looking for people like me  motivated people who had the drive to become a great professional and were only lacking the opportunity to show their potential  they train people in modern languages like ruby    this was not only an awesome opportunity to learn rails  but also to be in an environment that is difficult to find in other places  i was learning from the very best professionals and from an incredibly talented group of students           can you talk about a time when you got stuck in the class and how you pushed through      ironhack is an intensive bootcamp  you must be sure that you are able to push through any problem you have and my classmates were an important point to lean on  on one of my very first days at ironhack i was having trouble understanding one of the concepts that we were covering and it was through teamwork with my other classmates that we were all able to understand it     my classmates were as motivated as me so it was easy to find people to continue programming on weekends or after the class  it was great for me           what were your classmates and instructors like        in this bootcamp i was surrounded by the very best professionals from all over the country  so i can only say that it was a pleasure to convert their knowledge into mine  being able to share this experience with my classmates was awesome  if i could have the opportunity to do another ironhack bootcamp it would be amazing  they are the fastest two months i ve ever lived             tell us about your final project  what does it do  what technologies did you use  how long did it take  etc       well  my final project was about a travel application  with this web application you were able to save  organize and share all your trip information  this project was developed in two weeks and in order to achieve all the features that i wanted to include on it  i used rails  as i wanted to demonstrate all the things that i had learned in ironhack  i decided to include responsive web design  using css3  and javascript  jquery and html5 functionalities like geolocalization or web storage to improve the user experience     at the end of those two weeks i had a huge frontend project  which was more than i d ever expected  thanks to my hard work and efforts in this project i was one of the finalists in the hackshow  the ironhack final show where the finalists can show what they have made in two weeks  and i could show my project to more than a hundred people           what are you working on now  do you have a job as a developer  what does it entail      thanks to the hackshow two days after the end of ironhack i was working at floqq com  the biggest online education marketplace in spanish all over the world  nowadays  i m frontend developer and product manager at floqq com and i m working doing what i love to do   ironhack gave me the opportunity that other companies didn t give me  i had no experience and nobody wanted to hire me and now i m still learning and improving my skills in the best place i could ever find           would you have been able to learn what you now know without ironhack       it would be impossible to learn what i ve learned in ironhack in two months on my own  but it s not only about the development skills that i ve improved in those two months  it s also about the personal skills that i ve been able to develop and the opportunity to meet the best it professionals from all around spain  ironhack was just a   experience that changed my whole life  and that allowed me to do what i believe i was born to do           want to learn more about ironhack  check out their  school page  on course report or their  website here           founder spotlight  ariel quinones of ironhack      liz eggleston    4        ironhack            ironhack  is an 8 week coding bootcamp with campuses in madrid  barcelona  and soon  miami  we talked with cofounder ariel quinones about their rails curriculum  how they attract american students to  study abroad  in spain  and what sets ironhack apart             tell us about how ironhack started      i come from a finance background  i m originally from puerto rico  but spent 5 years in new york  my cofounder gonzalo comes from the construction industry  he s a civil engineer and he built all sorts of major infrastructure projects in europe  having said that  i come from a household of educators  both of my parents were teachers when i was growing up and my father actually started a private university in puerto rico   years ago that started with   students and now they have 6 campuses and over     students enrolled     i think education was always a part of my dna and i wanted to do something after completing my education  i met gonzalo during our mba  we were both at wharton  he also wanted to do something in education in europe and possibly in ed tech as well  during those 2 years of the mba we were iterating ideas  constantly and i think had the same issue that most non technical founders have in the u s   which is having brilliant  ideas  but once you get to the point where you need to execute them and produce an mvp  you re not able to do it  it s incredibly challenging to find a cofounder and it s incredibly challenging from a cost and also from an operational perspective to outsource the development     gonzalo and i took a 2 day course at wharton where they taught us to do very basic rails  even though we didn t acquire the skills necessary to build our mvp  we were excited about the possibility of teaching both technical and non technical people these skills through a highly intensive and compressed time period  after that experience  we started looking at the boot camp model  at that point  the earlier ones were starting to get a little bit of traction  we thought it would be interesting to do this somewhere abroad  i d done a lot of business in latin america so i had some ties to the region  gonzalo  my partner is spanish  so our first bet was spain           would you say that ironhack is more geared towards makers or technical cofounders as opposed to people who want to get a job at an established company as a junior developer      we ve had both profiles  we ve been selective in the people we admit from a technical background  we ve been hesitant so far to say  go from total newbie to professional web developer in x weeks   our approach is appealing to folks that are maybe already in close touch with technology and code  developers that want to professionalize their skills and take them to the next level  or people that are very smart  analytical and are looking for a hardcore experience that will allow them to learn from these types of people           when was the first cohort      the first cohort was in october of    each course is 8 weeks long           what was the biggest lesson that you learned after running your first cohort      one thing we learned is that the 8 weeks just fly by  when you plan for people to be coding   to   hours a day  that seems like a lot but every day goes by so quickly     the other thing we learned was that no matter how much you filter to make sure you don t have disparate levels prior to arriving  people just learn differently  at different velocities with different learning styles  so within the structure of 8 weeks we needed different exercises and flexibility to give people the chance to learn right at their own pace  while ensuring that everyone s learning fundamentals           do you have students do pre work before they get to ironhack      yeah  they do   hours of pre work           what cities are you live in now      we re live in madrid and barcelona and we re launching in miami in september           could you tell us about the tech scenes in the locations that you re live in  madrid and barcelona      people love to come to spain and study abroad  it s a country that has a lot to offer from the lifestyle perspective  you know  you have great food  the parties  study abroad in spain has been an integral part of spanish society for many years  within the traditional higher education arena  in our case  we re trying to position spain in a similar fashion  in the first cohorts we trained a lot of people from spain  but going forward we want to make it attractive for foreigners to come over and enjoy everything that spain has to offer and at the same time  learn how to code     barcelona is very exciting because you have people from all over the world that are launching startups there  obviously within the eu there s a lot of mobility  if you re a european union citizen  you can go anywhere without any sort of visa requirements  and i think a lot of northern europeans and people from germany for instance  love barcelona for weather reasons  the great beaches  the lifestyle  so a lot of them are coming over to barcelona to launch their own ventures here  in barcelona  the tech ecosystem is thriving and it s very international  there s a lot of mobile startups that are getting traction over there     madrid is still very much a cosmopolitan city and we re seeing a lot of traction in the startup space  it s obviously an emerging ecosystem  nowhere near silicon valley  but we re seeing early stage companies  get either acquired or go for substantial rounds of financing here in madrid  which is ultimately a driver for our type of business  companies need funding to employ engineers and we re seeing that capital flow to early stage projects           do you get interest from people in the u s       yes  right now we re getting a lot of interest from people all over the world  including the u s  i interviewed a few candidates from the northeast  we have another student from california who s enrolling in our june course           is it possible for someone from the u s  to complete ironhack and then work in spain or in the eu      yes  it s definitely possible  it s not as challenging as someone from europe to go to the u s  for sure  there s still costs that the employer has to incur but it has nowhere near the costs and all the red tape that you have to deal with in the u s           has ironhack raised any money      no  right now we re bootstrapped and we want to keep it that way as long as possible           so tell us what programming languages students are mastering at ironhack  tell us about the teaching style      we have two courses that are live right now  web and mobile     the web course is an 8 week course  i d say on average  students are with us in our offices       hours a day  we cover html  css and javascript on the front end  and then on the back we work with ruby on rails and teach a little bit of sinatra as well  the first 6 weeks we re teaching those core technologies  and the last 2 weeks  students are working on their own project from scratch  the culmination of the program is a demo day where they present their projects to the community  developers  startup cofounders  that type of audience     i d say    of our content is practical  we re big believers in the flipped classroom model  so we want to make sure that we reduce the amount of theory time to the extent possible  we get them all the resources  videos and exercises to complete at home prior to arriving here  while they re here we give them homework and assignments for the weekend so we can reduce that theory time     the technology demands in spain are very fragmented  it s not like san francisco where you can produce a gazillion ruby on rails grads every year and they ll be hired by rails startups  here  we re seeing some demand for rails startups   but also python  php  etc           do you expect that after completing your course  a graduate would be able to learn python or php on their own      a hundred percent  and we re seeing that  even though love the technologies we work with  we re not obsessed with them either  to us they re an instrument to teach good development practices  i think one thing that differentiates us from boot camps is our focus and obsession with good coding practices  we re obsessed with testing  clean code and good design patterns  we ve done our job if the student get a good background in technology but more importantly  take away those good coding practices that they apply to whatever language or framework they use           is the mobile class structured the same way      same format  exact same structure  slightly higher requirements to be accepted  in order to be accepted into the mobile course  you already have to program with another object oriented language  our first course is focused on ios development           do you think you ll ever do an android course      we ll probably do android in the near future           how many students do you have in each cohort      right now we ve capped at    we can probably go a bit more than that but we don t want to do more than that           how many instructors do you have per class      we always like to have a ratio of at least 6 students per teacher  so when we have   students  we have one main professor and two teaching assistants  our view is that if we re going to teach you one technology  we want to make sure that the person that is instructing you is the best  most capable person and is highly specialized in that language           how have you found instructors      we went to the best companies here in spain and other parts of europe and basically found the best people there  they work part time for us  it s very different to have someone who s fulltime boot camp professor versus someone who is a developer and is teaching at a boot camp for 2 weeks     and also from a recruiting perspective  a lot of our students have been hired by their teachers  also  our students have a network that goes beyond their peers and the ironhack staff  they have a network that connects to all these companies that these professors are coming from           you said that potential students should have some vested interest in programming and should have some background and be able to prove that they can really handle the material  what s the application process      we have a 3 step application process  the first part is a written form that we screen and then we do two   minute skype interviews  the first   minute skype interview is to get a sense of who you are  why you want to do this  and get a sense of is you fit within our culture  and if you have that intrinsic motivation to make the most out of the   hours that you have here     we say  listen  you re going to be coding monday through friday    hours a day and then you re going to have work every day on saturday sunday   when i tell them that  we want someone who beams energy and positivity  if they make it through that interview  we have a second round  which is basically to assess technical skills  we ve actually accepted a bunch of people that have never programmed before  but we want to make sure that you have the motivation and the analytical skill set to be able to catch up prior to arriving to our camp     in some cases  we have people that we think are very smart and incredibly motivated but have never coded in their lives  have never even worked with html  we admit them subject to another valuation post that second interview  so we ll get them to complete   hours of pre work and then see where they are           how does ironhack prepare your graduates to find jobs      the demo day is a great way to showcase our talent to our employers  and you have all sorts of employers there from the founding stage where they haven t raised any money or are still pre product  to tech employers who have technical teams and more than      employees    on top of the core curriculum we have speakers like employers come in during the 8 weeks to present their products and also it serves as an opportunity for them to get in touch with their students and identify potential hiring leads     we also bring in leading hr people from some of our top tech employers here to offer workshops on how to set up your cv  how to optimize your linkedin profile  seo and all these things  and we coach them on how to conduct an interview  right now we ve had the luxury of being small so we re all very involved in the process           are those companies paying a fee to get into the demo day or are they paying a recruiting fee once they ve hired someone      right now we re not charging employers  we re focused on placing    of our graduates and giving access to great companies  even those that wouldn t be interested in paying a recruiting fee             have you been successful in placing your graduates      we re starting to place a second cohort but in our first cohort  we placed nearly    percent of our graduates  i think in the first cohort we placed    of the people 3 week after the first course  and then the rest over the next 2 months           is the accreditation buzz that s happening in california anywhere on your radar  do you get any pressure from the government in spain or are you thinking about going through the accreditation process when you expand to miami      we re definitely going to pay attention to this in miami  we re all for it if it helps the student  as long as it doesn t interfere with the model and doesn t limit the ability of these institutions to offer education that s agile and that can adapt to the times and the technologies           are you planning on expanding beyond miami anytime soon      i think for the next year or even beyond that  we re going to focus on miami and spain  however  we re going to use miami and spain as hubs for other regions  we re getting a lot of interest from latin american students to come to spain  so for those who would rather come to miami because it s closer  we can offer that as well           to find out more about ironhack  check out their  school page  on course report or  their website

useful information  informing conclusions  and supporting decision making  data analysis has multiple facets and approaches  encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names  while being used in different business  science  and social science domains     data mining  is a particular data analysis technique that focuses on modeling and knowledge discovery for predictive rather than purely descriptive purposes  while  business intelligence  covers data analysis that relies heavily on aggregation  focusing mainly on business information    1    in statistical applications  data analysis can be divided into  descriptive statistics    exploratory data analysis   eda   and  confirmatory data analysis   cda   eda focuses on discovering new features in the data while cda focuses on confirming or falsifying existing  hypotheses    predictive analytics  focuses on application of statistical models for predictive forecasting or classification  while  text analytics  applies statistical  linguistic  and structural techniques to extract and classify information from textual sources  a species of  unstructured data   all of the above are varieties of data analysis     data

edit                   data science process flowchart from  doing data science   cathy o neil and rachel schutt        analysis refers to breaking a whole into its separate components for individual examination  data analysis is a  process  for obtaining raw data and converting it into information useful for decision making by users  data is collected and analyzed to answer questions  test hypotheses or disprove theories    2      statistician  john tukey  defined data analysis in   as   procedures for analyzing data  techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures  ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier  more precise or more accurate  and all the machinery and results of  mathematical  statistics which apply to analyzing data     3      there are several phases that can be distinguished  described below  the phases are iterative  in that feedback from later phases may result in additional work in earlier phases    4        data requirements      edit        the data is necessary as inputs to the analysis  which is specified based upon the requirements of those directing the analysis or customers  who will use the finished product of the analysis   the general type of entity upon which the data will be collected is referred to as an experimental unit  e g   a person or population of people   specific variables regarding a population  e g   age and income  may be specified and obtained   data may be numerical or categorical  i e   a text label for numbers     4        data collection      edit        data is collected from a variety of sources  the requirements may be communicated by analysts to custodians of the data  such as information technology personnel within an organization  the data may also be collected from sensors in the environment  such as traffic cameras  satellites  recording devices  etc  it may also be obtained through interviews   downloads from online sources  or reading documentation    4        data processing      edit                   the phases of the  intelligence cycle  used to convert raw information into actionable intelligence or knowledge are conceptually similar to the phases in data analysis      data initially obtained must be processed or organised for analysis  for instance  these may involve placing data into rows and columns in a table format  i e    structured data   for further analysis  such as within a spreadsheet or statistical software    4        data cleaning      edit        once processed and organised  the data may be incomplete  contain duplicates  or contain errors  the need for data cleaning will arise from problems in the way that data is entered and stored  data cleaning is the process of preventing and correcting these errors  common tasks include record matching  identifying inaccuracy of data  overall quality of existing data    5    deduplication  and column segmentation    6    such data problems can also be identified through a variety of analytical techniques  for example  with financial information  the totals for particular variables may be compared against separately published numbers believed to be reliable    7    unusual amounts above or below pre determined thresholds may also be reviewed   there are several types of data cleaning that depend on the type of data such as phone numbers  email addresses  employers etc   quantitative data methods for outlier detection can be used to get rid of likely incorrectly entered data  textual data spell checkers can be used to lessen the amount of mistyped words  but it is harder to tell if the words themselves are correct    8        exploratory data analysis      edit        once the data is cleaned  it can be analyzed  analysts may apply a variety of techniques referred to as  exploratory data analysis  to begin understanding the messages contained in the data    9           the process of exploration may result in additional data cleaning or additional requests for data  so these activities may be iterative in nature   descriptive statistics   such as the average or median  may be generated to help understand the data   data visualization  may also be used to examine the data in graphical format  to obtain additional insight regarding the messages within the data    4        modeling and algorithms      edit        mathematical formulas or models called  algorithms  may be applied to the data to identify relationships among the variables  such as  correlation  or  causation   in general terms  models may be developed to evaluate a particular variable in the data based on other variable s  in the data  with some residual error depending on model accuracy  i e   data   model   error     2       inferential statistics  includes techniques to measure relationships between particular variables   for example   regression analysis  may be used to model whether a change in advertising  independent variable x  explains the variation in sales  dependent variable y   in mathematical terms  y  sales  is a function of x  advertising   it may be described as y   ax   b   error  where the model is designed such that a and b minimize the error when the model predicts y for a given range of values of x  analysts may attempt to build models that are descriptive of the data to simplify analysis and communicate results    2        data product      edit        a data product is a computer application that takes data inputs and generates outputs  feeding them back into the environment  it may be based on a model or algorithm  an example is an application that analyzes data about customer purchasing history and recommends other purchases the customer might enjoy    4        communication      edit                    data visualization  to understand the results of a data analysis             main article   data visualization    once the data is analyzed  it may be reported in many formats to the users of the analysis to support their requirements  the users may have feedback  which results in additional analysis  as such  much of the analytical cycle is iterative    4      when determining how to communicate the results  the analyst may consider  data visualization  techniques to help clearly and efficiently communicate the message to the audience  data visualization uses  information displays   such as tables and charts  to help communicate key messages contained in the data  tables are helpful to a user who might lookup specific numbers  while charts  e g   bar charts or line charts  may help explain the quantitative messages contained in the data      quantitative messages      edit        main article   data visualization               a time series illustrated with a line chart demonstrating trends in u s  federal spending and revenue over time                 a scatterplot illustrating correlation between two variables  inflation and unemployment  measured at points in time      stephen few described eight types of quantitative messages that users may attempt to understand or communicate from a set of data and the associated graphs used to help communicate the message  customers specifying requirements and analysts performing the data analysis may consider these messages during the course of the process      time series  a single variable is captured over a period of time  such as the unemployment rate over a   year period  a  line chart  may be used to demonstrate the trend    ranking  categorical subdivisions are ranked in ascending or descending order  such as a ranking of sales performance  the  measure   by sales persons  the  category   with each sales person a  categorical subdivision   during a single period   a  bar chart  may be used to show the comparison across the sales persons    part to whole  categorical subdivisions are measured as a ratio to the whole  i e   a percentage out of       a  pie chart  or bar chart can show the comparison of ratios  such as the market share represented by competitors in a market    deviation  categorical subdivisions are compared against a reference  such as a comparison of actual vs  budget expenses for several departments of a business for a given time period   a bar chart can show comparison of the actual versus the reference amount    frequency distribution  shows the number of observations of a particular variable for given interval  such as the number of years in which the stock market return is between intervals such as 0           etc  a  histogram   a type of bar chart  may be used for this analysis    correlation  comparison between observations represented by two variables  x y  to determine if they tend to move in the same or opposite directions  for example  plotting unemployment  x  and inflation  y  for a sample of months  a  scatter plot  is typically used for this message    nominal comparison  comparing categorical subdivisions in no particular order  such as the sales volume by product code  a bar chart may be used for this comparison    geographic or geospatial  comparison of a variable across a map or layout  such as the unemployment rate by state or the number of persons on the various floors of a building  a  cartogram  is a typical graphic used                    techniques for analyzing quantitative data      edit        see also   problem solving    author jonathan koomey has recommended a series of best practices for understanding quantitative data   these include      check raw data for anomalies prior to performing your analysis    re perform important calculations  such as verifying columns of data that are formula driven    confirm main totals are the sum of subtotals    check relationships between numbers that should be related in a predictable way  such as ratios over time    normalize numbers to make comparisons easier  such as analyzing amounts per person or relative to gdp or as an index value relative to a base year    break problems into component parts by analyzing factors that led to the results  such as  dupont analysis  of return on equity    7       for the variables under examination  analysts typically obtain  descriptive statistics  for them  such as the mean  average    median   and  standard deviation   they may also analyze the  distribution  of the key variables to see how the individual values cluster around the mean                an illustration of the  mece principle  used for data analysis      the consultants at  mckinsey and company  named a technique for breaking a quantitative problem down into its component parts called the  mece principle   each layer can be broken down into its components  each of the sub components must be  mutually exclusive  of each other and  collectively  add up to the layer above them  the relationship is referred to as  mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive  or mece   for example  profit by definition can be broken down into total revenue and total cost  in turn  total revenue can be analyzed by its components  such as revenue of divisions a  b  and c  which are mutually exclusive of each other  and should add to the total revenue  collectively exhaustive     analysts may use robust statistical measurements to solve certain analytical problems   hypothesis testing  is used when a particular hypothesis about the true state of affairs is made by the analyst and data is gathered to determine whether that state of affairs is true or false  for example  the hypothesis might be that  unemployment has no effect on inflation   which relates to an economics concept called the  phillips curve   hypothesis testing involves considering the likelihood of  type i and type ii errors   which relate to whether the data supports accepting or rejecting the hypothesis     regression analysis  may be used when the analyst is trying to determine the extent to which independent variable x affects dependent variable y  e g    to what extent do changes in the unemployment rate  x  affect the inflation rate  y      this is an attempt to model or fit an equation line or curve to the data  such that y is a function of x     necessary condition analysis   nca  may be used when the analyst is trying to determine the extent to which independent variable x allows variable y  e g    to what extent is a certain unemployment rate  x  necessary for a certain inflation rate  y      whereas  multiple  regression analysis uses additive logic where each x variable can produce the outcome and the x s can compensate for each other  they are sufficient but not necessary   necessary condition analysis  nca  uses necessity logic  where one or more x variables allow the outcome to exist  but may not produce it  they are necessary but not sufficient   each single necessary condition must be present and compensation is not possible      analytical activities of data users      edit        users may have particular data

facts      daniel patrick moynihan        effective analysis requires obtaining relevant  facts  to answer questions  support a conclusion or formal  opinion   or test  hypotheses   facts by definition are irrefutable  meaning that any person involved in the analysis should be able to agree upon them  for example  in august    the  congressional budget office   cbo  estimated that extending the  bush tax cuts  of   and   for the     time period would add approximately  3 3 trillion to the national debt         everyone should be able to agree that indeed this is what cbo reported  they can all examine the report  this makes it a fact  whether persons agree or disagree with the cbo is their own opinion    as another example  the auditor of a public company must arrive at a formal opinion on whether financial statements of publicly traded corporations are  fairly stated  in all material respects   this requires extensive analysis of factual data and evidence to support their opinion  when making the leap from facts to opinions  there is always the possibility that the opinion is  erroneous       cognitive biases      edit        there are a variety of  cognitive biases  that can adversely affect analysis  for example   confirmation bias  is the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one s preconceptions  in addition  individuals may discredit information that does not support their views    analysts may be trained specifically to be aware of these biases and how to overcome them  in his book  psychology of intelligence analysis   retired cia analyst  richards heuer  wrote that analysts should clearly delineate their assumptions and chains of inference and specify the degree and source of the uncertainty involved in the conclusions  he emphasized procedures to help surface and debate alternative points of view             innumeracy      edit        effective analysts are generally adept with a variety of numerical techniques  however  audiences may not have such literacy with numbers or  numeracy   they are said to be innumerate   persons communicating the data may also be attempting to mislead or misinform  deliberately using bad numerical techniques           for example  whether a number is rising or falling may not be the key factor  more important may be the number relative to another number  such as the size of government revenue or spending relative to the size of the economy  gdp  or the amount of cost relative to revenue in corporate financial statements  this numerical technique is referred to as normalization   7    or common sizing  there are many such techniques employed by analysts  whether adjusting for inflation  i e   comparing real vs  nominal data  or considering population increases  demographics  etc  analysts apply a variety of techniques to address the various quantitative messages described in the section above    analysts may also analyze data under different assumptions or scenarios  for example  when analysts perform  financial statement analysis   they will often recast the financial statements under different assumptions to help arrive at an estimate of future cash flow  which they then discount to present value based on some interest rate  to determine the valuation of the company or its stock   similarly  the cbo analyzes the effects of various policy options on the government s revenue  outlays and deficits  creating alternative future scenarios for key measures      other topics      edit         smart buildings

this section contains rather technical explanations that may assist practitioners but are beyond the typical scope of a wikipedia article      initial data analysis      edit        the most important distinction between the initial data analysis phase and the main analysis phase  is that during initial data analysis one refrains from any analysis that is aimed at answering the original research question  the initial data analysis phase is guided by the following four questions             quality of data      edit        the quality of the data should be checked as early as possible  data quality can be assessed in several ways  using different types of analysis  frequency counts  descriptive statistics  mean  standard deviation  median   normality  skewness  kurtosis  frequency histograms  n  variables are compared with coding schemes of variables external to the data set  and possibly corrected if coding schemes are not comparable      test for  common method variance      the choice of analyses to assess the data quality during the initial data analysis phase depends on the analyses that will be conducted in the main analysis phase             quality of measurements      edit        the quality of the  measurement instruments  should only be checked during the initial data analysis phase when this is not the focus or research question of the study  one should check whether structure of measurement instruments corresponds to structure reported in the literature    there are two ways to assess measurement   note  only one way seems to be listed      analysis of homogeneity   internal consistency    which gives an indication of the  reliability  of a measurement instrument  during this analysis  one inspects the variances of the items and the scales  the  cronbach s   of the scales  and the change in the cronbach s alpha when an item would be deleted from a scale            initial transformations      edit        after assessing the quality of the data and of the measurements  one might decide to impute missing data  or to perform initial transformations of one or more variables  although this can also be done during the main analysis phase          possible transformations of variables are             square root transformation  if the distribution differs moderately from normal    log transformation  if the distribution differs substantially from normal    inverse transformation  if the distribution differs severely from normal    make categorical  ordinal   dichotomous   if the distribution differs severely from normal  and no transformations help        did the implementation of the study fulfill the intentions of the research design       edit        one should check the success of the  randomization  procedure  for instance by checking whether background and substantive variables are equally distributed within and across groups    if the study did not need or use a randomization procedure  one should check the success of the non random sampling  for instance by checking whether all subgroups of the population of interest are represented in sample   other possible data distortions that should be checked are       dropout   this should be identified during the initial data analysis phase    item  nonresponse   whether this is random or not should be assessed during the initial data analysis phase    treatment quality  using  manipulation checks               characteristics of data sample      edit        in any report or article  the structure of the sample must be accurately described  it is especially important to exactly determine the structure of the sample  and specifically the size of the subgroups  when subgroup analyses will be performed during the main analysis phase   the characteristics of the data sample can be assessed by looking at      basic statistics of important variables   scatter plots   correlations and associations   cross tabulations            final stage of the initial data analysis      edit        during the final stage  the findings of the initial data analysis are documented  and necessary  preferable  and possible corrective actions are taken   also  the original plan for the main data analyses can and should be specified in more detail or rewritten   in order to do this  several decisions about the main data analyses can and should be made      in the case of non  normals   should one  transform  variables  make variables categorical  ordinal dichotomous   adapt the analysis method    in the case of  missing data   should one neglect or impute the missing data  which imputation technique should be used    in the case of  outliers   should one use robust analysis techniques    in case items do not fit the scale  should one adapt the measurement instrument by omitting items  or rather ensure comparability with other  uses of the  measurement instrument s     in the case of  too  small subgroups  should one drop the hypothesis about inter group differences  or use small sample techniques  like exact tests or  bootstrapping     in case the  randomization  procedure seems to be defective  can and should one calculate  propensity scores  and include them as covariates in the main analyses             analysis      edit        several analyses can be used during the initial data analysis phase             univariate statistics  single variable    bivariate associations  correlations    graphical techniques  scatter plots     it is important to take the measurement levels of the variables into account for the analyses  as special statistical techniques are available for each level             nominal and ordinal variables   frequency counts  numbers and percentages    associations   circumambulations  crosstabulations    hierarchical loglinear analysis  restricted to a maximum of 8 variables    loglinear analysis  to identify relevant important variables and possible confounders      exact tests or bootstrapping  in case subgroups are small    computation of new variables     continuous variables   distribution   statistics  m  sd  variance  skewness  kurtosis    stem and leaf displays   box plots         nonlinear analysis      edit        nonlinear analysis will be necessary when the data is recorded from a  nonlinear system   nonlinear systems can exhibit complex dynamic effects including  bifurcations    chaos    harmonics  and  subharmonics  that cannot be analyzed using simple linear methods   nonlinear data analysis is closely related to  nonlinear system identification              main data analysis      edit        in the main analysis phase analyses aimed at answering the research question are performed as well as any other relevant analysis needed to write the first draft of the research report             exploratory and confirmatory approaches      edit        in the main analysis phase either an exploratory or confirmatory approach can be adopted  usually the approach is decided before data is collected  in an exploratory analysis no clear hypothesis is stated before analysing the data  and the data is searched for models that describe the data well  in a confirmatory analysis clear hypotheses about the data are tested     exploratory data analysis  should be interpreted carefully  when testing multiple models at once there is a high chance on finding at least one of them to be significant  but this can be due to a  type 1 error   it is important to always adjust the significance level when testing multiple models with  for example  a  bonferroni correction   also  one should not follow up an exploratory analysis with a confirmatory analysis in the same dataset  an exploratory analysis is used to find ideas for a theory  but not to test that theory as well  when a model is found exploratory in a dataset  then following up that analysis with a confirmatory analysis in the same dataset could simply mean that the results of the confirmatory analysis are due to the same  type 1 error  that resulted in the exploratory model in the first place  the confirmatory analysis therefore will not be more informative than the original exploratory analysis             stability of results      edit        it is important to obtain some indication about how generalizable the results are         while this is hard to check  one can look at the stability of the results  are the results reliable and reproducible  there are two main ways of doing this       cross validation   by splitting the data in multiple parts we can check if an analysis  like a fitted model  based on one part of the data generalizes to another part of the data as well     sensitivity analysis   a procedure to study the behavior of a system or model when global parameters are  systematically  varied  one way to do this is with bootstrapping      statistical methods      edit        many statistical methods have been used for statistical analyses  a

simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry  lorem ipsum has been the industry s standard dummy text ever since the    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book  it has survived not only five centuries  but also the leap into electronic typesetting  remaining essentially unchanged  it was popularised in the   with the release of letraset sheets containing lorem ipsum passages  and more recently with desktop publishing software like aldus pagemaker including versions of lorem ipsum       why do we use it    it is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout  the point of using lorem ipsum is that it has a more or less normal distribution of letters  as opposed to using  content here  content here   making it look like readable english  many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use lorem ipsum as their default model text  and a search for  lorem ipsum  will uncover many web sites still in their infancy  various versions have evolved over the years  sometimes by accident  sometimes on purpose  injected humour and the like         where does it come from    contrary to popular belief  lorem ipsum is not simply random text  it has roots in a piece of classical latin literature from   bc  making it over   years old  richard mcclintock  a latin professor at hampden sydney college in virginia  looked up one of the more obscure latin words  consectetur  from a lorem ipsum passage  and going through the cites of the word in classical literature  discovered the undoubtable source  lorem ipsum comes from sections 1     and 1     of  de finibus bonorum et malorum   the extremes of good and evil  by cicero  written in   bc  this book is a treatise on the theory of ethics  very popular during the renaissance  the first line of lorem ipsum   lorem ipsum dolor sit amet     comes from a line in section 1       the standard chunk of lorem ipsum used since the   is reproduced below for those interested  sections 1     and 1     from  de finibus bonorum et malorum  by cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form  accompanied by english versions from the   translation by h  rackham       where can i get some    there are many variations of passages of lorem ipsum available  but the majority have suffered alteration in some form  by injected humour  or randomised words which don t look even slightly believable  if you are going to use a passage of lorem ipsum  you need to be sure there isn t anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text  all the lorem ipsum generators on the internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary  making this the first true generator on the internet  it uses a dictionary of over   latin words  combined with a handful of model sentence structures  to generate lorem ipsum which looks reasonable  the generated lorem ipsum is therefore always free from repetition  injected humour  or non characteristic words etc                 paragraphs         words         bytes         lists          start with  lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and i will give you a complete account of the system  and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth  the master builder of human happiness  no one rejects  dislikes  or avoids pleasure itself  because it is pleasure  but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful  nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself  because it is pain  but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure  to take a trivial example  which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise  except to obtain some advantage from it  but who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences  or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure     section 1     of  de finibus bonorum et malorum   written by cicero in   bc    at vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident  similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi  id est laborum et dolorum fuga  et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio  nam libero tempore  cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus  omnis voluptas assumenda est  omnis dolor repellendus  temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis aut rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae sint et molestiae non recusandae  itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus  ut aut reiciendis voluptatibus maiores alias consequatur aut perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat       translation by h  rackham    on the other hand  we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment  so blinded by desire  that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue  and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will  which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain  these cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish  in a free hour  when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best  every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided  but in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted  the wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection  he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures  or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains           googletag cmd push function     googletag display  div gpt ad
